DataStructures Quiz 1
Which one of the below is not divide and conquer approach?
Insertion Sort
Merge Sort
Shell Sort
Heap Sort
1
Among the options, only Merge sort divides the list in sub-list, sorts and then merges them together

What data structure is used for breadth first traversal of a graph?
queue
stack
list
none of the above
0
Queue is used for breadth first traversal whereas stack is used for depth first traversal.

The following formular is of left_subtree (keys)  ≤  node (key)  ≤  right_subtree (keys)
Binary Tree
Complete Binary Tree
Binary Search Tree
All of the above
2
A binary search tree (BST) is a tree in which all nodes follows the below mentioned properties.<br>The left sub-tree of a node has key less than or equal to its parent node's key.<br>The right sub-tree of a node has key greater than or equal to its parent node's key.

The minimum number of edges required to create a cyclid graph of n vertices is
n
n - 1
n + 1
2n
0
To make a graph cyclic, the number of edges should be at least equal to vertices in the graph.

Which of the following has search effeciency of Ο(1) −
Tree
Heap
Hash Table
Linked-List
2
A simple hash table has the Ω(1) efficiency.

Quick sort running time depends on the selection of
size of array
pivot element
sequence of values
none of the above!
1
If the pivot element is balanced, quick sort running time will be less.

Which of the following is not possible with an array in C programming langauge −
Declaration
Definition
Dynamic Allocation
Array of strings
2
Array in C are static and cannot be shrinked or expanded in run-time.

In a min heap
minimum values are stored.
child nodes have less value than parent nodes.
parent nodes have less value than child nodes.
maximum value is contained by the root node.
2
In a min heap, parent nodes store lesser values than child nodes. The minimum value of the entire heap is stored at root.

If locality is a concern, you can use _______ to traverse the graph.
Breadth First Search
Depth First Search
Either BFS or DFS
None of the above!
1
DFS is a better choice when locality-wise items are concerned.

Apriori analysis of an algorithm assumes that −
the algorithm has been tested before in real environment.
all other factors like CPU speed are constant and have no effect on implementation.
the algorithm needs not to be practical.
none of the above.
1
Efficiency of algorithm is measured by assuming that all other factors e.g. processor speed, are constant and have no effect on implementation.
