If ‘relftaga’ means carefree, ‘otaga’ means careful and ‘fertaga’ means careless, which of the following could mean ‘aftercare’?
zentaga
tagafer
tagazen
relffer
2
'taga' and 'care' are a matching pair in every combination. So, 'taga' surely represents 'care'.   Also, note here that the second half of the word in encoded value refers to the first half of the word in the decoded value. So, 'fer' represents 'less', 'relf' represents 'free' and 'o' represents 'full'.   Going by the same logic, the answer would be tagazen, i.e., C.

A cube is built using 64 cubic blocks of side one unit. After it is built, one cubic block is removed from every corner of the cube. The resulting surface area of the body (in square units) after the removal is __________.
56
64
72
96
3
The surface area of the body will remain unchanged as when a cube is removed, it exposes three faces, which makes the number of exposed faces same as before removal.   So, surface area of the body before removal = surface area of the body after removal = 6 * side * side = 6 * 4 * 4 = 96.   Thus, D is the correct choice.
